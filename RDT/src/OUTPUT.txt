Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP).

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP).

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.

Received 209 bytes: The execution of network protocols is typically event-driven. Such events include the arrival of a message from the lower or higher level, and the expiration of a timer. The event is often called an interrupt.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time.

In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 605 bytes: Consider a layer n and its adjacent layers n+1 and n-1, as shown in the figure above. When layer n+1 has a message to send, it invokes the send interface provided by the layer n and passes the message to layer n. Layer n maintains a send buffer to store message to be sent (and to be retransmitted). If the buffer is already full when layer n+1 tries to send a message, an error will be returned. The send call will trigger an event so that the thread that is executing the layer n protocol can fetch the message in the send buffer and passes it to the lower layer (n-1) afternoon adding a layer n header.

Received 404 bytes: Similarly, when a message arrives at layer n-1, an event is generated and the layer n protocol thread is woken up to handle the message. In general, the message is initially stored in a receive buffer of layer n before it is delivered to layer n+1, for a number of reasons (e.g., to ensure source ordering in TCP). In our PAR protocol, this buffer is not used because the message is delivered right away.

Received 381 bytes: Since layer n-1 might be lossy, layer n must implements a retransmission mechanism to retransmit the messages to be sent, if the acknowledgement does not arrive in time. To do this, the protocol starts a timer each time it transmits (or retransmits) a message. If the timer expires, an event is generated and the protocol thread is woken up to perform the retransmission operation.

Received 730 bytes: Event-driven programming is not trivial. Therefore, you are provided with Java skeleton code and the binary (Java byte code) files for a reference implementation for this project. In the reference implementation, the main thread executes the PAR protocol, and a separate thread is used to pick up messages arrived from UDP in the simulated network layer. The timer is implemented using the facility provided by Java (java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask). You are strongly encouraged to build your project based on the skeleton Java code. However, you are free to choose a different programming language if you wish, in which case, you will have to implement the simulation environment as well as the PAR protocol from scratch.
